# SkinScan ML

This repository serves as the documentation of machine learning path's side of SkinScan app. This repository contains python notebooks for all experiments that have been done and the corresponding exported tfjs models.

Due to the huge size of .h5 files, this repository does not contains exported models in the form of .h5 files.
